    x --> Find library
        x --> Prove feasibility
    x --> Detect heart rate
    x --> Dissect library
        x --> Implement our own interface
        --> Be able to switch faces mid operation

> Face Recognition
    x --> Find library
    x --> Prove feasibility
    --> Get lots of training data
    x --> Implement our own FaceRec package

> Smile detection
    x --> Find library
    x --> Prove feasibility (Haar Cascade!)
    --> Make micropackage

# Other stuff
> Interfacing with Facebook to get likes (Fake this?)

# Pipeline
    --> Detect face
        --> Recognize Person
            --> Display Likes
        --> Determine heart-rate
        --> Determine if smiling
        --> Determine blink-rate

# Demo
    - Animations
    - Don't do a live demo!
    - Looking at a single person, talking to them
